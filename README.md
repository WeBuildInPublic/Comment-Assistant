# Comment Assistant

Welcome to the Comment Assistant VSCode extension!

## Features

This extension allows users to add comments after they are finished working on a file with one easy-to-use command.

To document a code file, simply open the command pallette using `Ctrl+Shift+P`, run the `Comment Code` command, and select the file you wish to add comments to. Thorough documentation and inline comments will be added to the program in no time!

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Release Notes

Currently, the extension documents whole files at a time and supports any programming language. More features may be added in the future.

**Enjoy!**
