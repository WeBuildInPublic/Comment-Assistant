# Comment Assistant

Welcome to the Comment Assistant VSCode extension!

## Features

This extension allows users to add comments after they are finished working on a file with one easy-to-use command.

To document a code file, simply open the command pallette using `Ctrl+Shift+P`, run the `Comment Code` command, and select the file you wish to add comments to. Thorough documentation and inline comments will be added to the program in no time!
